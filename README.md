# Computer Vision 

This whole respository is made for my fun Computer Vision projects. I have decided to start with OpenCV. In my OpenCV project I have provided detail explanation of code and of the concepts to learn for basic computer vision. I have showed how to segment, blur, detect objects, edge detection, use OpenCV's library, detect faces and so much more.
